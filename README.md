# minimalistic_game_console

A minimilastic game console with an attiny85, a 5 button ad keyboard, a 8x7 segment red led and a buzzer

I made it to simulate a game I had when I was young : battlestar galactica - space alert , from mattel

before taking the time to make a schematics :
for the 8*7 led segment :
DIN -> PB1
CS -> PB3
CLK -> PB4

Keyboard out -> A1

Buzzer  + -> PB0
